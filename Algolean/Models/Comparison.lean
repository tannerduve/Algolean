# Query Type for Comparisons

In this file we define a query type `Comparison` for comparison based algorithms, whose sole query
`compare` compares two arguments. It further defines a model `Comparison.natCost` for this query.
--

## Definitions

- `Comparison`: A query type for comparison based algorithms.
- `Comparison.natCost`:  A model for this query with costs in `ℕ`.

/--
A query type for comparing elements. It supports exactly one query
`compare x y` which returns `true` if `x` is equal to `y`
and returns `false` otherwise.
-/
inductive Comparison (α : Type*) : Type → Type _ where
  | compare (x y : α) : Comparison α Bool


/-- A model of the `Comparison` query type that assigns the cost as the number of queries. -/

    | .compare x y => x == y
  cost _ := 1
