# Query Complexity Classes

Complexity classes defined parametrically over query types and cost types.
A single framework covers comparison complexity, query complexity,
Turing machine time/space, circuit depth, and any other cost model
expressible via `Model Q Cost`.

## Main definitions

- `QueryProblem Q Cost α`: a problem whose specification depends on the model
- `Solves`: a program correctly solves a problem for all models
- `SolvesWithin`: a program solves a problem within a cost bound for all models
- `QueryProblem.InClass`: a problem is in a complexity class (existential over programs)
- `QueryProblem.ReducesTo`: one problem reduces to another with bounded overhead

## Design

The key idea is that in the query model, the problem specification depends
on the oracle (model). For sorting, "correct" means "the output is the
sorted version of the input determined by the comparison oracle." This
dependence is captured by `QueryProblem.spec : Model Q Cost → α → Prop`.

/-- A problem in the query model. The specification depends on the model
because the "correct answer" is determined by the oracle. -/

  /-- The correctness specification, parameterized by the model. -/

/-- `P` solves `prob` for all models: the result satisfies the spec
regardless of oracle. -/
def Solves (P : Prog Q α) (prob : QueryProblem Q Cost α) : Prop :=
  ∀ M : Model Q Cost, prob.spec M (P.eval M)

/-- `P` solves `prob` within cost `bound` under a specific model `M`.
This is the model-specific version, used when the model is fixed
(e.g., Turing machines have a unique model `TMModel tm`). -/

    (P : Prog Q α) (prob : QueryProblem Q Cost α)
    (M : Model Q Cost) (bound : Cost) : Prop :=
  prob.spec M (P.eval M) ∧ P.time M ≤ bound

/-- `P` solves `prob` within cost `bound` for all models.
This is the oracle-universal version, used when the program must be
correct regardless of which oracle it faces (e.g., comparison sort
must work for all orderings). -/

there exists a program solving it within that bound. -/

/-! ## Composition via bind -/

/-- Composition of programs via bind: if `op` runs within `bound₁`
and the continuation runs within `bound₂` on the result, then
`op >>= cont` runs within `bound₁ + bound₂`. The combined problem
asks for the continuation's spec applied to the result of `op`. -/

/-! ## Reductions between problems -/

/-- Contravariant map on `QueryProblem`: transport a problem along a
map of models. Analogous to `Filter.comap`, `Ideal.comap`, etc. -/

/-- If `P` solves `prob` for all models, and the reduction correctly
implements each query, then the reduced program solves the transported
problem. -/

  rw [Prog.reduceProg_eval P red (pullback M₂) M₂ (hCorrect M₂)]
  exact hSolves (pullback M₂)

/-- A problem `prob₁` reduces to `prob₂` if any program solving `prob₂`
can be transformed into one solving `prob₁` within bounded overhead. -/

  ∀ (P : Prog Q α) (bound : Cost),
    SolvesWithin P prob₂ bound →
    ∃ P' : Prog Q α, SolvesWithin P' prob₁ (bound + overhead)

/-- If `prob` is in the complexity class for `bound`, and has
overhead `c` reduction to `prob'` which is in class `bound'`,
then `prob` is in class `bound' + c`. -/

/-! ## Uniform families of programs

For complexity classes like BQP, we need a single program *family*
`(n : ℕ) → Prog Q (α n)` that works uniformly across input sizes, with a
polynomial bound on cost as `n` grows. This is the family-indexed lift
of `QueryProblem` / `InClass`.

`UniformFamily.Uniform` is the cost-bounded analog; `SatisfiesSpec` is
the correctness analog. A complexity class like `BQP` is an existential
over `UniformFamily` bundles whose members satisfy both.
-/

/-- A family of programs indexed by input size. -/
structure UniformFamily (Q : Type u → Type u) (α : ℕ → Type u) where
  /-- The program for input size `n`. -/
  prog : (n : ℕ) → Prog Q (α n)

/-- The family runs within the given per-size cost bound under a model. -/
def UniformFamily.Uniform [AddZero Cost] [Preorder Cost]
    (fam : UniformFamily Q α) (M : Model Q Cost) (bound : ℕ → Cost) : Prop :=
  ∀ n, (fam.prog n).time M ≤ bound n

/-- The family's evaluation satisfies the given per-size correctness spec. -/
def UniformFamily.SatisfiesSpec
    (fam : UniformFamily Q α) (M : Model Q Cost)
    (spec : (n : ℕ) → α n → Prop) : Prop :=
  ∀ n, spec n ((fam.prog n).eval M)
